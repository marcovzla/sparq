* Major change: calculi-dependent relation representation
* More precomputation when compiling calculi
* Improved the general heuristics in a-closure (only slightly, I'm afraid...)
* Improved heuristics in backtracking search (scenario consistency)
* Introduced algebraic specification


0.6.2

0.6
---
* Started this history ;-)
* New calculi
