SparQ is currently not available in binary versions. To install and use
SparQ, you need

 * gcc and g++, version 2.95 or higher
 * GNU libtool, version 1.4.3 or higher
 * Steel Bank Common Lisp (SBCL), version 0.9.10 or higher

The source code of the actual version of SparQ and appropriate
documentation is available at the SparQ-homepage

http://www.sfbtr8.uni-bremen.de/project/r3/sparq/


To build a running version of SparQ, unpack the source code package,
enter the newly created SparQ directory (called sparq-<version>) and
run

./configure

Usually, no errors should occur and you should be able to build the
SparQ executables by running

make

All executables will be installed within the SparQ directory. Please
note that you have to recompile SparQ if you move the directory to
another place.

Further instructions can be found in the SparQ Manual. If you encounter
any problems during the build process, please contact the authors. If you
use Mac Os X, please refer to README.MacOsX.
