Installing SparQ on MacOsX 
==========================

Some of the portings of GNU libtool to MacOsX are known to
be buggy. SparQ, however, relies on libtool to build dynamic
libraries.

If you are using MacOsX, please do the following:

 1. Run './configure' as usual
 2. Run './patch-libtool' (this implies only local modifications
    and does not change anything on your system).
 3. Run 'make'

This is known to work on Darwin with libtool 1.5.10.
